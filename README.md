## Parking Lot

### Abstract

Instead of making a boring animation, we make it into a game features with

‚Äã1. Lovely drawing of UFO and rocket, etc.
2. Teleport can transform into polygons with a different number of sides and change color during the transformation.
3. To make it more fun, we make it an interactive game, see the [game rules](#game-rules) below.

### Game Rules

The player will control a rocket, which appears in a random teleport at the beginning, and your goal is to destroy all the vehicles before they all have parking.

In detail,

1. Your initial position is at a random teleport.
2. If more than three vehicles are parked successfully, you lose.
3. If your rocket bumps into another vehicle, it will collapse and you lose.
4. You can only leave less than three vehicles parked successfully, or you lose.

### Control

- Move: `w` (up), `a` (turn left), `s` (down), `d` (turn right).
- Shoot: `space` (to shoot a laser with delay)

### Implementation Detail

1. Our Rocket doesn't zoom in and out, instead, we zoom in and out of the flames to make it more real.
2. Our car is replaced with a cute cart, and the flag is replaced with a windmill.
