​		Input : The parkinglot's total floors number , the total time of this program.

​		Output : two types of tickets : one is arrival ticket, another is departure ticket.

​		Parkinglot set up : For only one floor, there will have equally four types of slot for each types of vehicles, and if there is more than one floor, the first floor will always be devided to two parts, one is for bicycle, another is for motorbike. And for higher floor, each floor will also be devided to two parts, one is for vans, another is for cars.

## Part B

### Bonus And Creativity:

​		1.We use a lovely cart, UFO and rocket.

​		2.Teleport can transform from n sides polygon to n+1 sides polygon and keep going until it reach the limit, and then it will automatically decrease to the lower limit smoothly, and also, change color during the transform.

​		3.To make it more fun, we make it an interactive game, see the GameRules below.

### GameRules:

		1.Player will control a rocket,which appears in a random teleport at the 			beginning, and your goal is to destory all the vehicles before they all have 			parked.

     		2. Your initial position is at a random teleport.
     		3. If more than three vehicles parked sucessfully, you lose.
     		4. If your rocket bump into another vehicles, it will collapse and you lose.
     		5. You can only left less than three vehicles parked sucessfully, or you lose.

### Control:

Move: W( up ) A( turn left ) S( down ) D( turn right ) 

Shoot: Space( to shoot a laser with delay ) 

### Notice:

1. In order to achieve this game, we use namespace to restore the game.
2. Our Rocket don't zoom in and zoom out, instead, we zoom in and out the flames to make it more real.
3. Our car is replaced with a cute cart, and the flag is replaced with a windmill.

## Enjoy!
