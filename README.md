# README - Project 3 Parking Lot Game

## Bonus And Creativity:

​		1.We use a lovely cart, UFO and rocket.

​		2.Teleport can transform from n sides polygon to n+1 sides polygon and keep going until it reach the limit, and then it will automatically decrease to the lower limit smoothly, and also, change color during the transform.

​		3.To make it more fun, we make it an interactive game, see the GameRules below.

## GameRules:

		1. Player will control a rocket,which appears in a random teleport at the beginning.
		2. Your goal is to destory all the vehicles before they all have parked.
		3. Your initial position is at a random teleport.
		4. If more than three vehicles parked sucessfully, you lose.
		5. If your rocket bump into another vehicles, it will collapse and you lose.
		6. You can only left less than three vehicles parked sucessfully, or you lose.

## Control:

Move: W( up ) A( turn left ) S( down ) D( turn right ) 

Shoot: Space( to shoot a laser with delay ) 

## Notice:

1. In order to achieve this game, we use namespace to restore the game.
2. Our Rocket don't zoom in and zoom out, instead, we zoom in and out the flames to make it more real.
3. Our car is replaced with a cute cart, and the flag is replaced with a windmill.
